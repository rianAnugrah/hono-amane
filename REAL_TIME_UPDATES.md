# Real-Time Inspection Updates Fix

## Problem
Previously, when users added signatures to an inspection, the PDF download button would not appear immediately. Users had to refresh the page to see the updated state because the parent component's inspection data wasn't being updated in real-time.

## Solution
Implemented immediate state updates between the `InspectionApproval` component and its parent `InspectionDetail` component.

### Key Changes

1. **Added `onInspectionUpdate` callback prop** to `InspectionApproval` component
   - Allows immediate communication of state changes to parent
   - Passes updated signature data and status changes

2. **Enhanced signature save/remove functions**
   - Now immediately update parent component state
   - No need to wait for API calls or page refresh

3. **Added `handleInspectionUpdate` function** in `InspectionDetail`
   - Receives real-time updates from approval component
   - Immediately updates local inspection state

### Flow
1. User signs approval → Signature saved to database
2. `InspectionApproval` updates its local state
3. Calls `onInspectionUpdate` with new signature data
4. `InspectionDetail` immediately updates its inspection state
5. PDF button appears instantly without page refresh

### Benefits
- ✅ Instant UI updates
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ No page refresh required
- ✅ Real-time status changes
- ✅ Immediate PDF availability

## Technical Implementation

```tsx
// InspectionApproval component
const updateData = {
  [`${currentApprovalRole}_signature_data`]: signatureData,
  [`${currentApprovalRole}_signature_timestamp`]: new Date().toISOString()
};

if (bothSignaturesPresent) {
  updateData.status = 'completed';
}

// Update parent immediately
if (onInspectionUpdate) {
  onInspectionUpdate(updateData);
}
```

```tsx
// InspectionDetail component
const handleInspectionUpdate = (updatedFields) => {
  if (inspection) {
    const updatedInspection = { ...inspection, ...updatedFields };
    setInspection(updatedInspection);
  }
};
```

This ensures that the UI reflects changes immediately without requiring any page refreshes or manual data fetching.
