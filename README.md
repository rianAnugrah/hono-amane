# Hono Amane Project

## Apple-Inspired Design System

We've implemented a consistent, Apple-inspired design system throughout the application. This design system ensures a cohesive user experience with clean, minimalist UI components.

### Key Design Principles

- **Clean, minimalist design** with ample white space
- **Subtle animations and transitions** for a fluid experience
- **Consistent rounded corners** and visual hierarchy
- **Accessible controls** with proper keyboard navigation
- **Clear error states** and validation

### Design System Components

Our design system includes the following components:

- **Button**: Multiple variants (primary, secondary, tertiary, danger, success), sizes, and icon support
- **InputText**: Floating label design with validation states
- **Checkbox**: Animated checkboxes with proper accessibility support
- **Switch**: Apple-like toggle switches with smooth animations
- **Badge**: Multiple colors and variants for status indicators
- **Select**: Dropdown with search capabilities and keyboard navigation
- **DatePicker**: Calendar component with range selection support

### Design System Demo

### Usage Guidelines

When developing new components or modifying existing ones:

1. Use the existing components from the design system whenever possible
2. Follow the established patterns for layout, spacing, and typography
3. Maintain accessibility by supporting keyboard navigation and screen readers
4. Use provided color tokens for consistency

For more detailed information on each component, please refer to the component source code in `components/ui/`.
